## Description
This was an attempt to create visualizations using HTML/CSS/JavaScript opposed to off-the-shelf python libaries such as matplotlib. In this case, there is more ability to manipulate charts to conform to best practices for presentation opposed to visualizing for EDA purposes on the fly.

The visualization is thematic and incorporates data from the country of Ecuador to draw conclusions regarding recent deforestation and CO2 emissions.
